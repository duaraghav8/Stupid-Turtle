# Stupid-Turtle
This is an extremely stupid python-based turtle born because around 900 keystrokes weren't careful! He keeps taking random steps in random directions and sometimes hides from our view. Nevertheless, he had to be born because our Dean posed this little challenge to our class during our 1st Semester.

The turtle also relies on an audio file "insect_sound.mp3" which must be in the same directory as the source file.

*Here is the final result's video:*
